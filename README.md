# Input_Validation_RegEx
JavaScript, PHP &amp; HTML Code - Web_Programming

<b>This HTML and JavaScript code creates a form for user credentials (username, password, email, etc.) 
With built-in client-side validation using regular expressions (regex). 
The form ensures that the data entered adheres to specific formats before being submitted.</b>

<h3> Why This is Important </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring usernames and passwords meet specific criteria prevents invalid or malicious inputs that could lead to security issues like SQL injection or XSS attacks.</li>
  <li>Ensures that users create secure passwords, reducing the risk of brute-force or dictionary attacks.</li>
  <li>While client-side validation enhances usability and improves user experience, sensitive data must also be validated and sanitized server-side for robust security</li>
</ul>
